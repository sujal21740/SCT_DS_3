Task 3: Predicting Customer Purchases with a Decision Tree Classifier

During my internship at SkillCraft Technology, I successfully designed and implemented a Decision Tree Classifier to forecast customer purchasing behavior. Utilizing demographic and behavioral data, this predictive model accurately identified potential customers likely to purchase a product¬†or¬†service.

üîç Key Insights from My Decision Tree Classifier Project:

Accuracy: Achieved an impressive 89.3% on the test set.
Metrics:
Precision and recall were strong for non-subscribers, with a weighted F1-score of 0.88.
Highlighted the need to improve detection of subscribers (class 1).
Visualizations:
Detailed decision tree diagram for interpretability.
Feature importance chart showcasing influential predictors.
Distribution analysis and correlation heatmap for exploratory insights.
Learning Curve: Demonstrated robust performance and consistency across training sizes.# SCT_DS_3
